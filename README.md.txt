--Renewable Energy Usage Analysis & Visualization
--About the Project

This project analyzes household-level renewable energy usage data and presents insights using data visualization techniques in Python.
The goal is to understand how energy usage varies over time and across different regions, income levels, and area types (urban vs rural).

This repository demonstrates:

Data analysis workflow

Use of Python visualization libraries

Clear presentation of insights using charts

--Problem Statement

Renewable energy adoption is increasing globally, but understanding usage patterns across demographics and regions is essential for better planning and policy-making.

This project aims to answer:

How does renewable energy usage change over the years?

Which energy sources are used the most?

Is there a difference between urban and rural energy usage?

How does income level affect energy consumption?

--Dataset Overview

The dataset contains household-level renewable energy information with attributes such as:
Year of usage
Region and country
Type of renewable energy source
Monthly energy consumption (kWh)
Income level
Urban or rural classification
Cost savings from renewable energy
The dataset is used only for analysis and visualization purposes.

--Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas – data handling and preprocessing
Matplotlib – plotting graphs
Seaborn – advanced visualizations
Jupyter Notebook – development environment

--Visualizations & Insights
1. Year-wise Energy Usage Trend
A line chart was used to analyze how monthly renewable energy usage changes over time.
Insight:
Renewable energy usage shows a generally increasing trend over the years.
2. Energy Source Distribution
A pie chart was used to represent the percentage contribution of different renewable energy sources.
Insight:
Some energy sources (e.g., Solar) dominate overall usage compared to others.
3. Urban vs Rural Energy Usage
A bar chart compares average monthly energy usage between urban and rural households.
Insight:
Urban households tend to have higher average energy consumption.
4. Income Level vs Energy Usage
A box plot was used to study energy usage variation across income groups.
Insight:
Higher income groups show greater variation and higher median energy usage.
