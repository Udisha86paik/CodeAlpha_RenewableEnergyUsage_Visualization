# Renewable Energy Usage Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing renewable energy usage data using Python.  
It explores trends, patterns, and comparisons across years, regions, income levels, and urban–rural classifications through effective data visualizations.

The project is developed as part of a  internship submission and demonstrates core data analysis and visualization skills.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze renewable energy usage trends over time  
- Compare energy consumption across different demographics  
- Visualize data using clear and informative charts  
- Gain insights from real-world structured data  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains household-level renewable energy information with the following key attributes:

- `Household_ID`
- `Region`
- `Country`
- `Energy_Source`
- `Monthly_Usage_kWh`
- `Year`
- `Household_Size`
- `Income_Level`
- `Urban_Rural`
- `Adoption_Year`
- `Subsidy_Received`
- `Cost_Savings_USD`

The dataset is used solely for educational and analytical purposes.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Methodology
1. Imported and explored the dataset  
2. Performed data cleaning and column inspection  
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Created multiple visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
5. Interpreted trends and patterns from the plots

## Visualizations Included

### 1. Year-wise Renewable Energy Usage
A line chart showing how renewable energy usage changes over different years.

**Insight:**  
Renewable energy usage shows a gradual increasing trend over time.

---

### 2. Energy Source Distribution
A pie chart representing the proportion of different renewable energy sources.

**Insight:**  
Certain energy sources dominate overall usage compared to others.

---

### 3. Urban vs Rural Energy Consumption
A bar chart comparing average monthly energy usage between urban and rural households.

**Insight:**  
Urban households generally consume more energy than rural households.

---

### 4. Income Level vs Energy Usage
A box plot illustrating energy usage distribution across income groups.

**Insight:**  
Higher income groups show greater variation and higher median energy consumption.

---

## Key Findings
- Renewable energy adoption is increasing over the years  
- Energy usage varies significantly across income levels  
- Urban households tend to consume more renewable energy  
- Visualization helps identify patterns not easily visible in raw data
